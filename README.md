a (semi)functional version of The Gravity Hull editor tool by superllama for Garry's Mod 13

Current Issues that need a'fixing:

    -Thirdperson breaks with WAC

    -Can't inflict damage on entities using bullet-based sweps
    
    -Players cannot be shot from inside or outside a hull

    -Players cannot inflict damage upon each other in a hull
    
    -The enitre tool is co-dependent on the obsolete/experimental map repeat function/feature 

    -exiting a hull will teleport you to a random position (can't narrow down what triggers this)

    -Vehicles don't work properly in a hull
     
    -Ragdolls simply don't worknow

    -Gravity percentage slider seems to be broken for world entities such as players

    -You can pick up func_rotating_doors with a hull, it'll duplicate and displace itself in the skybox

    -Can't get inside of seats whilst in hulls

    -Getting a inside a seat inside a hull derenders all props and entities
    
    -Inform me about any more issues I missed



Fixed issues

    -Viewmodels refuse to render
Thanks to Z0MB1N3

    -Bringing a vehicle with wheels near a hull'd prop breaks the world (Props and objects bounce up and down)
 Fixed due to unknown reason (New Update possibly?)

    -Breaks with Falco's prop protection
Fixed thanks to the great Falco himself
