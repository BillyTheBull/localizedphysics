a (semi)functional version of The Gravity Hull editor tool by superllama for Garry's Mod 13
Current Issues that need a'fixing:
    -Thirdperson breaks with WAC
    -Bringing a vehicle with wheels near a hull'd prop breaks the world (Props and objects bounce up and down)
    -Viewmodels refuse to render
    -Players cannot be shot from inside or outside a hull
    -The enitre tool is co-dependent on the obsolete/experimental map repeat function 
  -Inform me about any more issues I missed
